names = ['bob', 'joe', 'susan', 'margaret']

names['margaret'] = 'jody'

=begin
the issue is you are trying to index in to the array using the word margaret,
indexing via bracket notation requires a integer, you can can change margaret to jody
by using margaret's index number [3] to change that value to jody
